# Notes about 

_Internet & World Wide Web How to Program, 4/e_

In 1995, we saw an explosion of interest in the Internet and the World Wide Web. We immersed ourselves in these technologies, and a clear picture started to emerge in our minds of the next direction to take in writing textbooks for introductory programming courses. **Electronic commerce**, or **e-commerce**, as it is typically called, began to dominate the business, financial and computer industry news. This was a reconceptualization of the way business should be conducted. We still wanted to teach programming principles, but we felt compelled to do it in the context of the technologies that businesses and organiza- tions need to create Internet-based and web-based applications. With this realization, the first edition of _Internet & World Wide Web How to Program_ was born and published in December of 1999.

_Internet & World Wide Web How to Program, Fourth Edition_ teaches programming languages and programming language principles. In addition, we focus on the broad range of technologies that will help you build real-world Internet-based and web-based applica- tions that interact with other applications and with databases. These capabilities allow you to develop the kinds of enterprise-level, distributed applications popular in industry today.

You’ll learn computer programming and basic principles of computer science and information technology. You also will learn proven software development methods—top- down stepwise-refinement, functionalization and object-based programming. Our pri- mary programming language is JavaScript, a compact language that is especially designed for developing Internet- and web-based applications. Chapters 6–13 present a rich discus- sion of JavaScript and its capabilities, including dozens of complete examples followed by screen images that illustrate typical program inputs and outputs.

After you learn programming principles from the detailed JavaScript discussions, we present condensed treatments of four other popular Internet/web programming languages for building the server side of Internet- and web-based client/server applications. Chapter 23 introduces the popular PHP scripting language. Chapter 24 introduces Ruby, the scripting language used with the Ruby on Rails framework for rapid development of database-driven web applications. In Chapter 25, we discuss ASP.NET 2.0—Microsoft’s technology for server-side scripting. ASP.NET pages can be written in Visual Basic and C#; we code ASP.NET pages using Visual Basic. In Chapters 26–27, we discuss JavaServer Faces, which uses the Java programming language. Finally, in Chapter 28, we discuss web services (using examples in both Java and ASP.NET).
