# BASIC, Visual Basic, Visual C++, C# and .NET

The **BASIC** (Beginner’s All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language was developed in the mid-1960s at Dartmouth College as a means of writing simple pro- grams. BASIC’s primary purpose was to familiarize novices with programming techniques. Microsoft’s Visual Basic language, introduced in the early 1990s to simplify the develop- ment of Microsoft Windows applications, has become one of the most popular program- ming languages in the world.

Microsoft’s latest development tools are part of its corporatewide strategy for inte- grating the Internet and the web into computer applications. This strategy is implemented in Microsoft’s **.NET platform**, which provides the capabilities developers need to create computer applications that can execute on computers distributed across the Internet. Microsoft’s three primary programming languages are **Visual Basic** (based on the original BASIC), **Visual C++** (based on C++) and **Visual C#** (a relatively new language based on C++ and Java that was developed expressly for the .NET platform). Developers using .NET can write software components in the language they are most familiar with, then form applications by combining those components with others written in any .NET language.
