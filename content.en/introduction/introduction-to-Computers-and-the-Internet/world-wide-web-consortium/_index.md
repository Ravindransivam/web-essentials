# World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)

In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee founded an organization—called the **World Wide Web Consortium** (**W3C**)—devoted to developing nonproprietary, interoperable technologies for the World Wide Web. One of the W3C’s primary goals is to make the web uni- versally accessible—regardless of ability, language or culture. The W3C home page (www.w3.org) provides extensive resources on Internet and web technologies.

The W3C is also a standardization organization. Web technologies standardized by the W3C are called **Recommendations**. W3C Recommendations include the Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), HyperText Markup Language (HTML—now considered a “legacy” technology) and the Extensible Markup Language (XML). A recommendation is not an actual software product, but a document that specifies a technology’s role, syntax rules and so forth.
