# Introduction to the Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 Web Browsers

The Internet is an essential medium for communicating and interacting with people worldwide. The need to publish and share information has fueled the rapid growth of the web. **Web browsers** are software programs that allow users to access the web’s rich content. Whether for business or personal use, millions of people use web browsers to access the tremendous amount of information available on the web and to share or exchange this content with other users. The www portion of the Internet, which we encounter often in this chapter, is made up of hyperlinked documents written in XHTML and rich media.

Popular web browsers at the time of publication are Microsoft’s _Internet Explorer_, Mozilla’s _Firefox_, Apple’s _Safari_ and Opera Software’s _Opera_. This chapter focuses on the features of Internet Explorer (IE7) and Firefox 2 (FF2), which are the most widely used of these browsers. All examples in this book are supported by both IE7 and FF2.
