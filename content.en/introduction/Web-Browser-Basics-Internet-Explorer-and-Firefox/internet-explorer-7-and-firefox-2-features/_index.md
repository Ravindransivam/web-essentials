# Internet Explorer 7 and Firefox 2 Features

A web browser is software that allows the user to view certain types of Internet files in an interactive environment. Figure 2.1 shows the Deitel Home Page using Internet Explorer 7 web browser, and Fig. 2.2 uses Firefox 2. The **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** http://www.deitel.com is found in the **Address** bar in IE7, and the **Location** bar in FF2. The URL specifies the address (i.e., location) of the web page displayed in the browser window. Each web page on the Internet is associated with a unique URL. URLs usually begin with http://, which stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**, the standard protocol (or set of communication rules) for transferring web documents over the Inter- net. URLs of websites that handle private information, such as credit card numbers, often

begin with https://, the abbreviation for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (HTTPS)**, the standard for transferring encrypted data on the web.

There are several techniques for navigating between URLs. You can click the **Address** field and type a web page’s URL, then press _Enter_ or click **Go** (in IE7, this is the same button as **Refresh**) to request the web page located at that URL. For example, to visit Yahoo!’s website, type www.yahoo.com in the **Address** bar and press the _Enter_ key. Clicking **Refresh** loads the latest version of the web page from the current website. IE7 and FF2, as well as most other popular browsers, add the http:// prefix to the website name because HTTP is the default protocol used for the web.

**_Hyperlinks_**
Another way to navigate the web is via visual elements on web pages called **hyperlinks** that, when clicked, load a specified web document. Both images and text may be hyperlinked. When the mouse pointer hovers over a hyperlink, the default arrow pointer changes into a hand with the index finger pointing upward. Often hyperlinked text appears underlined and as in different color from regular text in a web page. Originally used as a publishing tool for scientific research, hyperlinks are widely used to reference sources, or sites that have more information on a particular topic. The paths created by hyperlinking create the effect of the “web.”

Hyperlinks can reference other web pages, e-mail addresses, files and more. If a hyper- link’s URL is in the form mailto:_emailAddress_, clicking the link loads your default e-mail program and opens a **message window** addressed to the specified e-mail address. Note that these hyperlinks are generally displayed on the screen as just the e-mail address or the recipient’s name.

If a hyperlink references a file that the browser is incapable of displaying, the browser prepares to **download** the file, and generally prompts the user for information about how the file should be stored. When a file is downloaded, it is copied onto the user’s computer. Programs, documents, images and sound files are all examples of downloadable files.

**_Tabbed Browsing_**
Many browsers, including IE7 and FF2, provide **tabbed browsing**. Holding down the _Ctrl_ key and pressing the letter _T_ while in the IE7 or FF2 browser opens another tab in the same window, allowing the user to browse multiple pages without cluttering the desktop with many windows. [_Note:_ For Mac users, all references to the _Ctrl_ key in this chapter’s shortcuts should be replaced with the _Command_ key.\] Also, pressing _Ctrl_ while clicking a link will open the requested page in a new tab. Clicking on the tabs switches between the different pages in the browser, and web pages are then accessed normally. Using tabs is an excellent way to keep the browser organized when viewing multiple pages at once.

**_Using the History Feature_**
IE7 and FF2 maintain a **History** list of previously visited URLs in chronological order. This feature allows users to return to recently visited websites easily. The history feature can be accessed several different ways. The simplest and most frequently used method is to click the **Forward** and **Back** buttons located at the top of the browser window (see Fig. 2.1). The **Back** button reloads into the browser the page you last visited. Assuming that you used the **Back** button to view previously visited pages, the **Forward** button would load the next URL from the history into the browser. The keyboard shortcut for **Forward** is _<Alt_\> and the _Right Arrow_ key or just _Shift_ and _Backspace_, and the shortcut for **Back** is _<Alt_\> and the _Left Arrow_ key or simply _Backspace_.

In IE7, the user can view the last and next nine web pages visited and the current page by clicking the down arrows immediately to the right of the **Forward** button; the user can then request one of the recently viewed pages by clicking the title of the page in the drop- down list. In FF2, there are separate menus to the right of both the **Forward** and the **Back** buttons. Each displays the previous and following fifteen pages in the history, respectively. Note that these methods only display history results from the browser’s current **session**, which is the period when the browser remains open. In IE7 and FF2, there is a menu to the right of the address bar which displays a longer but more basic history of visited sites (it does not include any URLs accessed through hyperlinks), including websites that were visited in previous sessions. Another way to display sites from a previous session is to use **History**.

Selecting **History** from the down-arrow menu in IE7, or clicking the **History** menu, then the **Show In Sidebar** option in FF2, divides the browser window into two sections: the **History** window (on the left) and the content window (Figs. 2.3–2.4). In IE7, clicking the yellow star icon in the upper left of the window, then selecting the **History** option, dis- plays a similar menu. By default, the **History** window lists the URLs visited in the past twenty days in IE7 and nine days in FF2.

The **History** window contains heading levels ordered chronologically. Within each time frame (e.g., **Today**) headings are alphabetized by website name (although the organi- zation can be changed clicking the **History** drop-down menu in IE7 or the **View** drop-down menu of FF2, both located in the **History** window). This window is useful for finding pre- viously visited websites without having to remember the exact URL. Selecting a URL from the **History** window loads the web page into the content window.

**_AutoComplete_**
URLs from the history can be displayed in a drop-down list when a user types a URL into the **Address** bar. This feature is called **AutoComplete**. Any URL from this drop-down list can be selected with the mouse to load the web page at that URL into the browser (Fig. 2.5).

**_Off-Line Browsing_**
For some users, such as those with dial-up connections, maintaining a connection for long periods of time may not be practical. For this reason, web pages can be saved directly to the computer’s hard drive for **off-line** browsing (i.e., browsing while not connected to the Internet). Select **Save As…** in IE7, or **Save Page As…** in FF2, both from the **File** menu to save a web page and all its components, including the images. [_Note:_ To display the **File** menu in IE7, press the _Alt_ key.\] This option is also available under the **Page** menu in IE7 (Fig. 2.1). Individual images from a website can also be saved by clicking the image with the right mouse button and selecting **Save Picture As…** (IE7) **or Save Image As...** (FF2) from the displayed **context menu** (Fig. 2.6).

**_Downloads_**
As mentioned earlier, files from the Internet may be copied to a computer’s hard drive by a process called **downloading**. This section discusses the types of documents commonly downloaded from the Internet and techniques for downloading them.[_Note:_ You should always be cautious when downloading files from the Internet, as they may contain viruses. Only download from sites that you trust.\]

Some common Internet downloads are **applications** (i.e., software that performs spe- cific functions, such as word processing), **plug-ins** and **extensions**. Plug-ins are specialized pieces of software that help the browser support additional content types. An example of an IE7 and FF2 plug-in is the **Acrobat Reader** from **Adobe, Inc.** (www.adobe.com/ products/acrobat/readstep2.html), which allows users to view **PDF (Portable Docu-ment Format)** documents that otherwise cannot be rendered by the browser. Another popular plug-in allows the browser to render **Flash** content, which adds audio, video and animation effects to a website. To view sites enabled with Flash, download the Adobe Flash Player plug-in at www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer. Microsoft’s rich media plug-in, **Silverlight**, is available for download at silverlight.net/GetStarted. (Both Flash and Silverlight are discussed in much greater depth in Chapters 16, 17 and 19). Nor- mally the browser prompts the user to download a plug-in when one is needed. Plug-ins may also be downloaded from CNET (www.download.com). This site has a large, search- able index and database of many plug-in programs available for download.

Extensions are add-ons that enhance the preexisting functionality of the browser. Examples of extensions include blog editors, universal uploaders and various translation dictionaries and tools. Many IE7 add-ons can be found at www.ieaddons.com, and FF2 add-ons can be browsed and downloaded at https://addons.mozilla.org.

**_Viewing Source Code_**
Clicking on the **View** menu followed by the **Source** option in IE7 and **Page Source** in FF2 allows you to view the **source code**, or the original code written to create the web page you are viewing. Generally, source code is easy for humans to read and interpret, and allows the viewer to understand how the programmer created the page. For example, if an ele- ment of a web page does not display properly, examining the source code can help to in- form the user what the programmer was trying to do. Examining source code is a useful tool for debugging your own code, or for learning how web developers create some of the elements you see on the web.
