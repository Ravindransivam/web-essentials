# Online Help

Web browsers are complex pieces of software with rich functionality. Although browser designers make every effort to produce user-friendly software, users still need time to fa- miliarize themselves with each web browser and its particular features. Answers to fre- quently asked questions about using the web browser are included with FF2 and IE7, as well as most other browsers. This information is accessible through the built-in help fea- ture available in the **Help** menu (Figs. 2.14–2.15).

A good source for locating help about a specific feature is the **Contents and Index** menu item in IE7 and **Help Contents** in FF2, both accessible through the **Help** menu. IE’s help menu can also be accessed by clicking the **Help** option on the toolbar’s chevron. When these items are selected, the browser’s help dialog is displayed. In IE7, the **Contents** tab organizes the help topics by category, the **Index** tab contains an alphabetical list of **Help** topics and the **Search** tab provides capabilities for searching the help documents. The **Favorites** tab allows users to maintain a list of frequently used help topics. FF2’s **Help** window provides a search box and an expandable table of contents for browsing.
