# Keeping Track of Your Favorite Sites

As users browse the web, they often visit certain sites repeatedly and may want to record their URL and title. IE7 provides a feature called **favorites** for bookmarking (keeping track of) such sites (Fig. 2.11). Any page’s URL can be added to the list of favorites using the **Favorites** menu’s **Add to Favorites…** command, or by pressing the yellow star and green plus icon in the upper left corner of the window. A **Favorites** window can also be accessed by clicking the yellow star icon on the toolbar and clicking the **Favorites** option. Favorites can be accessed at any time by selecting them with the mouse from the **Favorites** menu. Favorites can be categorized and grouped into folders in the **Organize Favorites** dialog (dis- played when **Organize Favorites…** is selected from the **Favorites** menu). These folders ap- pear as submenus in the **Favorites** menu. The **Organize Favorites** dialog also allows users to rename, delete and move favorites between folders.

FF2 has a similar feature called **bookmarks**, which can be added with the **Bookmark This Page...** option in the **Bookmark** menu and used the same way that **Favorites** are described in this section (Fig. 2.12). Most browsers have their own version of **Favorites** or **Bookmarks**.
