# Wrap-Up

In this chapter, we described the requirements for connecting to the Internet, and we in- troduced the basic features of Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 7 and Mozilla’s Firefox 2. You learned how to customize your browsing experience to fit your personal needs, and how to exchange data safely using the Internet. We also discussed how to use search engines to find information on the web and demonstrated how to keep track of useful sites. In the next chapter, we discuss the defining characteristics of Web 2.0 and how it has changed the way that users interact with the Internet.
