# Sending the HTTP Request
- The browser sends an **HTTP request** to the server. This request includes:
  - **Method** (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
  - **URL Path** (e.g., `/index.html`).
  - **Headers** (e.g., browser type, cookies, etc.).
  - Optional **body** for methods like `POST`.

---

# Server Processes the Request
- The web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) receives the request and determines how to handle it.
- If the website is dynamic, the server may:
  - Run backend code (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).
  - Query a **database** for additional data.
- If the website is static, the server retrieves the requested file (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from its storage.

---

# Generating the Response
- The server generates an **HTTP response** containing:
  - **Status code** (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`).
  - **Headers** (e.g., content type, cache control).
  - **Response body**, such as HTML, CSS, JSON, or an image.

---

# Sending the Response
- The server sends the HTTP response back to the browser over the established TCP connection.

---

# Browser Renders the Content
- The browser receives the response and begins rendering the web page:
  1. **HTML Parsing:** Constructs the DOM (Document Object Model).
  2. **CSS Parsing:** Applies styles.
  3. **JavaScript Execution:** Adds interactivity.
  4. **Resource Requests:** Downloads additional assets (images, scripts, stylesheets).

---

# User Interaction with the Page
- Once the page is loaded, the user can interact with it. Any further actions (e.g., clicking buttons) may trigger additional HTTP requests, restarting the flow.

---

# Example: Opening a Website
1. The user types `www.example.com` in the browser.
2. DNS resolves it to `192.168.1.1`.
3. A connection is established, and the browser sends a `GET` request for `/index.html`.
4. The server processes the request and responds with the HTML file.
5. The browser renders the page and requests additional resources (CSS, JS, images).
6. The user interacts with the page, possibly triggering more requests.

This cycle repeats throughout a browsing session.
